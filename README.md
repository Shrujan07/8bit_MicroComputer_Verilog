# 8bit_MicroComputer_Verilog
This project was inspired by the efforts of Ben Eater to build an 8 bit computer on a breadboard. Even though this one was not built on a breadboard, it has the functionalities of his computer and modelled using Verilog HDL. This was developed for the Mini Project in Digital Systems course in my 3rd semester at IIT Palakkad.
